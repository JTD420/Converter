# Setup
Place the files in C:\Tools</br>
make sure you got NPM installed : https://nodejs.org/en/download/</br>
run : C:\tools\FirstRun.bat this will install the Nitro converter</br>

# Step 1
Download all the swf's with the download tool : C:\Tools\DownloadHabbo\Habbo_Downloader.exe

for the first time you need to run the following in the console:

Download Furniture</br>
Download Effects</br>
Download Icons</br>
Download Productdata</br>
Download Furnidata</br>
Download Texts</br>
Clothes

# Step 2
run the "c:\Tools\run.bat" this will confurt all the SWF / Config files to .nitro and .json for the config.</br>
We already place the default and extra effects in "C:\Tools\asset_default" so this will be done automaticly.</br>

And that's it you are ready to Rock !

* Please note this is for the default furniture only, all costums your on your own !
